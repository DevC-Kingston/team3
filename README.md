## Inspiration
Here are some of the motivations why we have created this chatbot, QSocial :
1. A drive to learn new things. As student Developers, it's in our nature to learn a new programming language, platform, etc.
2. Self-satisfaction. It's a great feeling to achieve something.
3. A drive to create something useful for other people.
4. Career advancement. The skills and knowledge We can gain will be useful for our future careers.
5.Perseverance. Having that drive to complete our masterpiece.


## What it does
This is a conversational agent that helps with problems on many popular social platforms (eg. Instagram, Facebook, Twitter). At QSocial We help our customers with an efficient reporting option compiled with the step by step safety and security forms.


## List your Chatbot’s features and use cases
1. Quick reporting of account impersonation, theft or fraud without unnecessary waiting.
2. Recovering a deleted account by mistake without filling out forms (The chatbot will already have access your personal information because it was already inputted by the user during sign-up).
3. Easier and more efficient access to social media platform’s simple to complete forms. (All report forms will be complied together in one place. All you have to do is ask the chat bot for the report form and you have the option of filling it out yourself or automatically by the chatbot.)
